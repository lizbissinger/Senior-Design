# Rashminder Gill - Assignment #3 - Individual Capstone Assessment

## Project Overview

My senior design project involves developing a web-based solution to address significant inefficiencies in the logistics chain. Our primary focus is on addressing the issues faced by carriers, who act as mediators between brokers (suppliers) and drivers (transporters). There is a big void in the logistics industry in terms of a comprehensive platform that allows carriers to efficiently handle loads, trucks, and drivers. This void results in excessive time and resource waste. As a result, the primary goal of our project is to bridge this gap by offering a uniform platform that streamlines communication, automates operations, and improves data integrity.

## Leveraging College Experience

As we embark on this journey, our collective college experiences will serve as invaluable guides for the development of our senior design project. Firstly, our computer science curriculum has been instrumental in equipping us with the essential technical knowledge and skills required for designing and implementing a robust web application. Courses such as CS 1021C (Computer Science I), CS 2021 (Python Programming), and CS 2028C (Data Structures) have provided me with the fundamental programming principles, data manipulation techniques, and algorithmic understanding that form the bedrock of our project.

Furthermore, our co-op experiences have been crucial in preparing us for this attempt. In my instance, I had the opportunity to work on web applications using cutting-edge technologies such as React, GraphQL, and AWS Lambda during my full-stack developer co-op at Siemens. This hands-on experience has greatly improved my ability to construct secure and scalable web solutions, which will immediately benefit our senior design project. In addition, several team members have obtained vital industry insights from their co-op experiences, ensuring that our team has a well-rounded skill set that smoothly mixes theoretical understanding with practical application.

## Motivation

Our motivation for participating in this initiative originates from a thorough awareness of the issues confronting the trucking and logistics industries. Three of our staff members operate family-owned trucking companies, giving us unique insight into the issues that carriers face on a daily basis. We are excited about the idea of developing a solution that would not only improve the productivity of our businesses but will also benefit millions more carriers across the United States who are suffering similar issues.

## Project Approach

Our preliminary approach involves the development of a web-based application offering carriers a unified platform for efficiently managing loads, trucks, and drivers. This encompassing platform will incorporate features such as real-time GPS tracking, automated invoice generation, driver payroll calculation, financial insights, and document management. We anticipate that our solution will streamline operations, reduce manual tasks, enhance data accuracy, and facilitate better communication among carriers, drivers, and brokers.

## Evaluation Strategy

We have developed a comprehensive approach to effectively evaluating our efforts. We will establish clear project goals and deliverables, such as finishing specific features and completing rigorous user testing. Collaborative code reviews and user comments will also be part of our evaluation process. Furthermore, to assess the project's success, we will regularly monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as load processing times, invoice correctness, and user happiness. This iterative evaluation process will ensure that we not only fulfill our aims but also provide a high-quality solution that solves the logistics industry's pressing needs.
