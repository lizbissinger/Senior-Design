## Project Summary

In the logistics cycle, there are brokers, carriers, and drivers. Carriers act as the liaison between brokers and drivers; providing a service to connect brokers (suppliers) with drivers (transporters). Carriers lack a way to manage loads, trucks, and drivers on one platform. This project's goal is to bridge this gap by saving time, hassle, and potential mistakes. This application will allow information to be relayed to brokers in a time-effective manner as well as allowing drivers and carriers to be more efficient in passing information to each other. Without a comparable application, a company will waste time and money on inefficient ways of managing documents, payroll, tracking loads, payments, and account receivables, etc.

## Problem Statement

In the logistics cycle, carriers lack an efficient way to manage loads, trucks, and drivers on one platform, resulting in inefficiencies that waste time and money. Additionally, brokers are often unable to access information in a timely manner, leading to potential mistakes and delays. The absence of a comprehensive application for managing logistics creates a need for an integrated platform that connects carriers, brokers, and drivers, improving communication and increasing efficiency in the transportation process. This project aims to bridge this gap and provide a solution that saves time, streamlines operations, and reduces potential errors.

## Solution

Our solution will be a web-based application that will let the carriers track information about loads, drivers, and real-time information on where they are, status of the load, reports at the end of the year for tax purposes, revenue, and expense reports, integrated GPS to see the live location of drivers, invoice generation features to get payment from brokers, and aging history of loads.
